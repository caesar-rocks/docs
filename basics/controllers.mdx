In Caesar, a controller is a struct that wraps [HTTP handlers](./routing#route-handler). Controllers are used to group related handlers together and to provide a way to share common functionality across multiple handlers.

## Creating a controller

To create a controller, you can type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
caesar make:controller
```

This command will create a new controller file in the `app/controllers` directory of your app, as well as registering the controller in the `config/app.go` file.
