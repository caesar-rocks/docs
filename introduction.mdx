## What is Caesar?

Caesar is a Go web framework, designed for **productivity**. It takes inspiration from traditional web frameworks such as [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/), etc.

As of today, Go developers have to **spend tremendous time** architecting their web applications, setting up the project structure, configuring the database, 
choosing the right routing library, and so on.

Caesar aims to solve this problem by providing a set of **tools** and **conventions** that allow developers to focus on building their web applications, rather than setting them up.

## Why is it called Caesar?

The name Caesar is inspired by the Roman general and statesman, [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar). Caesar was known for his military campaigns, and his ability to conquer new territories.

In the same way, Caesar aims to help developers conquer the web, by providing them with the tools they need to build web applications quickly and efficiently.
