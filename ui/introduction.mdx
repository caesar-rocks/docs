Caesar provides a library of components that you can use to build your web app. 
These components are built using [Templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) (the recommended template engine), [HTMX](https://htmx.org) (a small JS lib for AJAX requests), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) (for styling).

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a web application">
   If not already done, create a new web application using the Caesar CLI.

   ```bash
   caesar new
   ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Inter font">
    While you are free to use any font you like, we recommend using the Inter font for your web app.

    Add the Inter font to your project by adding the following line to your `views/app.css` file:

    ```css
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap');
    ```

    Then, register it in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      theme: {
        extend: {
          fontFamily: {
            sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
          },
        },
      },
    };
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up the TailwindCSS Animate plugin">
    CaesarUI makes use of the [TailwindCSS Animate](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate) plugin to provide animations for its components.

    Install it by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss-animate
    ```

    Then, add it to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      // ...
      plugins: [
        require('tailwindcss-animate'),
      ],
    };
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your first Caesar component">
    Now, you can start adding components to your web app.

    For example, to add a button component, you can use the following code:

    ```bash
    caesar ui:add button
    ```

    This will add a new button component to your `views/ui` directory, and append some styles in your `views/app.css` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use your Caesar component">
    You can now use the button component in your views.

    For example, to use the button component in your `views/welcome.tmpl` file, you can add the following code:

    ```go
    package pages

    import (
        "starter_kit/views/layouts"
        "starter_kit/views/ui"
    )

    templ WelcomePage() {
        @layouts.SharedLayout() {
            @ui.Button(ui.ButtonProps{
                Variant: ui.ButtonVariantDanger,
            }) {
                Danger
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why providing UI components?">
    [Templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org) are still relatively new in the Go ecosystem, and there are not many resources available to help developers build web apps using these tools. 
    By providing a library of components, we aim to make it easier for developers to build web apps using Caesar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the components?">
    Yes, you can customize the components to fit your needs.
    You can modify the component files in the `views/ui` directory, and the styles in the `views/app.css` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are these components free to use?">
    Yes, these components are free to use (for personal and commercial use) in your web app.
    You can modify them, distribute them, and use them in any way you like.

    Moreover, feel free to share what you are building with these UI components.
